# ExerciseScript
Simple script to create exercise routine schedule.

Features:
  * Adds days to the routine (no duplicates) every time it runs.
  * Will keep a 1:1 sync with the exercise list 
      > add/remove exercise will reflect on the final routine
      > removing will delete the progress of said exercise
  * Exports routine to an excel file.
  
  
TO-DO:
  * Support moving exercises without losing progress
  * OneDrive support (?)
  * Connect this to some back-end (Heroku?)
  * Front-end work to replace the Excel format. 
  * Export a png (?) to send to the phone
  
Overall Goal:
  * Track progress and adquire as much Data as possible to build ML/DL models to predict the next routine and the intensity (sets/reps/weight)
